# Snowflake

**Snowflake** is both a programming language and interpreter.

The hypothetical device it is designed for is something in-between a 1970's microprocessor
trainer like the [KIM-1][2] and a 1980's pocket computer like the [Sharp PC-1500][3]. 
The target hardware has these properties:

* Memory-bound rather than CPU-bound.
* [Numeric keypad][1] as the alphanumeric input device.
* 20 characters wide output.

The resulting language is likewise something between machine code and BASIC. It is
plaintext [bytecode][4] that the interpreter provides facilities to make human-readable.
Snowflake is [Turing-complete][5] and uses the [Polish notation][6].

## Documentation

The documentation is split into the following files:

* Documentation for compiling and using the interpreter ([interpreter.md][9]).
* The complete reference to the Snowflake programming language ([language-reference.md][7]).
* Break-down of a snowflake file ([hello-world.md][8]).
* The snowflake file format ([file-format.md][11]).
* How this repository is laid out ([project-structure.md][10]).
* Why this project exists ([rationale.md][12]).
