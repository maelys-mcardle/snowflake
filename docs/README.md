# Snowflake Language

**Snowflake** is a programming language made designed with microcontrollers as both the editing 
and execution environment. It is designed for this hypothetical device:

* The target device is memory-bound rather than CPU-bound.
* Numeric keypad as the input device including [for typing letters][1]
* The output is 20 characters wide.

Conceptualize a device that's a mish-mash of a [KIM-1][2] and a 1980's pocket computer like 
the [Sharp PC-1500][3]. This resulting language is like human-writeable bytecode.
Snowflake is [Turing-complete][4] and uses the [Polish notation][5].
