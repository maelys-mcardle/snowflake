# Snowflake

**Snowflake** is both a programming language and interpreter.

The hypothetical device it is designed for is something in-between a [KIM-1][2] 
and a 1980's pocket computer like the [Sharp PC-1500][3]. It is:

* Memory-bound rather than CPU-bound.
* [Numeric keypad][1] as the alphanumeric input device.
* 20 characters wide output.

This language is like human-writeable bytecode. Snowflake is 
[Turing-complete][4] and uses the [Polish notation][5].

## Documentation

The documentation is split into the following files:

* Documentation for compiling and using the interpreter ([interpreter.md][8]).
* The complete reference to the Snowflake programming language ([language-reference.md][6]).
* Break-down of a snowflake file ([hello-world.md][7]).
* The snowflake file format ([file-format.md][10]).
* How this repository is laid out ([project-structure.md][9]).
