;; Hello World
;; 
;; This program outputs "Hello World!" to the LCD:

10 00 HELLO WORLD!    ;; Store "HELLO WORLD!" to Bank 00
03 00 00              ;; Display the contents of Bank 00

;; The interpreter would parse the above as follows:
;; 
;; VAR @00 HELLO WORLD!    ;; Store "HELLO WORLD!" to Bank 00
;;  << OUT @00             ;; Display the contents of Bank 00
