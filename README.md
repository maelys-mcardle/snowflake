# Snowflake

Snowflake is an interpreted programming language made for microcontrollers.

## Author

Snowflake was developed for fun by [MaÃ«lys McArdle][1].

## Getting Started

To get and compile the Snowflake interpreter, run the following:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:maelys-mcardle/snowflake.git

# Switch into the repository directory
cd snowflake

# Compile the interpreter
make
```

Then test by running a sample file:

```
./snowflake --run samples/hello-world.sn
```

More information is found in the [interpreter][2] documentation.

## Writing Snowflake Code

Snowflake code looks a bit like machine code. There are instructions, devices,
banks and labels and these are all written using digits. Here's one program
written in Snowflake which gives a random number between 1 and 6:

```
;; Output title.
14 00 ROLL THE DICE ;;
03 00 00            ;; Output "ROLL THE DICE"

;; Set the values.
04 03 01            ;; BANK @01 = RANDOM_NUMBER
12 02 06            ;; BANK @02 = 6
12 03 01            ;; BANK @03 = 1

;; Provide a random number between 1 and 6.
34 01 02            ;; BANK @01 = RANDOM_NUMBER % 6
30 01 03            ;; BANK @01 = (RANDOM_NUMBER % 6) + 1
03 00 01            ;; Output BANK @01
```

To learn how to write code in Snowflake, see the documentation in the 
[docs][3] directory. To see code for other programs written in Snowflake,
see the [samples][3] directory.
