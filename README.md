# Snowflake

Snowflake is an interpreted programming language made for microcontrollers. The language itself
occupies the space in between machine code and BASIC. It was developed for fun by [MaÃ«lys McArdle][1].

This repository contains an implementation of the interpreter. Documentation on how to 
code with the language is found in the [docs][2] directory. Examples of code written in
Snowflake is found in the [samples][3] directory.

## Interpreter

This project comes with an interpreter to parse and execute Snowflake code.

### Compile

Compilation of the interpreter requires [make][4], a C compiler with [c11][5] support, as well as [glibc][6].

To compile the interpreter, run the command:
```
make
```

To compile with debug symbols run the command:
```
make debug
```

### Run

To see how the interpreter understands the Snowflake program, run:

```
./snowflake --print your-snowflake-program.sn
```

To execute a Snowflake program, run:
```
./snowflake --run your-snowflake-program.sn
```

### Debugging

If your Snowflake program isn't parsed or executed as expected, you can use
the `--debug` option. This will give in-depth information about what the interpreter
is doing at each step. You do not need the debug build of the interpreter to 
use this flag:

```
./snowflake --print --run --debug your-snowflake-program.sn
```

### Clean

To delete files created during compilation, run the command:
```
make clean
```
