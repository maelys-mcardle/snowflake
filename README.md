# Snowflake

Snowflake is an interpreted programming language made for microcontrollers. The language itself
occupies the space in between machine code and BASIC. It was developed for fun by [MaÃ«lys McArdle][1].

This repository contains an implementation of the interpreter. Documentation on how to 
code with the language is found in the [docs][2] directory. Examples of code written in
Snowflake is found in the [samples][3] directory.

## Interpreter

This project comes with an interpreter to parse and execute Snowflake code.

### Compile

Compilation of the interpreter requires [make][4], a C compiler with [c11][5] support, as well as [glibc][6].

To compile the interpreter, run the command:
```
make
```

To compile a debug build, run the command:
```
make debug
```

### Run

To run a Snowflake program, execute:
```
./snowflake --run your-code-file.sn
```

To see how the interpreter understands the code file, run:
```
./snowflake --print your-code-file.sn
```

If you run into issues, use the `--debug` option on the code. It will give more
information about how the interpreter understood the code, and what it was running.
You do not need the debug build of the interpreter to use this flag:
```
./snowflake --print --run --debug your-code-file.sn
```

### Clean

To delete files created during compilation, run the command:
```
make clean
```
